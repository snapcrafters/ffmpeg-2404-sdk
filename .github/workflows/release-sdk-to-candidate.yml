          testing-instructions: |
            1. Grab the manifest of a snap that uses ffmpeg, for eg: [Tagger](https://github.com/NickvisionApps/tagger-snap/blob/main/snap/snapcraft.yaml)
            1. Update the manifest to use ffmpeg-2404-sdk from candidate channel
            like this, https://github.com/NickvisionApps/tagger-snap/blob/main/snap/snapcraft.yaml#L21
            1. Build the snap and see if it builds perfectly
